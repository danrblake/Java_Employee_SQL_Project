# Java_Employee_SQL_Project

This Project was created in order to explore SQL and Java integration. Currently the project reads a given CSV file, parses this information
and adds this to a hashmap. From this the hashmap is then sent to a SQL Database where the information is persisted. 

Once the above was completed, varying SQL queries were created in order to access specific information, add new employees to our database,
extract all employees, delete employee from database and update employee information.

Alongside all of this Tests were created to ensure minimal project risk and regression tests were created to ensure no knock on effects
are seen when changes are made.
